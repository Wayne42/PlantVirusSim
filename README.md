# PlantVirusSim
a naive and simple simulation of a field of plants...
randomized plants get infected and slowly die :(

# Why?
This simulation is needed to simulate and model something for https://igem.org/ 

I needed something like this to quickly create importable csv's for KeplerGL,
but the objective slowly shifts...

It is fun to have control over so many plants ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜‡
